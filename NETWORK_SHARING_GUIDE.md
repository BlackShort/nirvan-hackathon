# üåê Network Sharing Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Setup Instructions

### 1. Start Your Servers with Network Access

**Backend Server:**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
Your backend will be accessible at: `http://192.168.137.135:5000`

**Frontend Server:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Your frontend will be accessible at: `http://192.168.137.135:5173`

### 2. Configure Windows Firewall

**Method 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)**
1. Press `Windows + R`
2. Type `firewall.cpl` and press Enter
3. Click "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall"
4. Click "Change settings" (requires admin)
5. Click "Allow another app..."
6. Find and add:
   - `Node.js` (for your backend server)
   - `Chrome/Firefox` (for your frontend)
7. Check both "Private" and "Public" boxes
8. Click OK

**Method 2: Command Line (Run as Administrator)**
```cmd
# Allow Node.js through firewall
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Node.js Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5000

# Allow Vite dev server
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Vite Dev Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5173
```

### 3. Share Your URLs

**Your App URL (for others on network):**
```
http://192.168.137.135:5173
```

**What others can access:**
- ‚úÖ Search functionality
- ‚úÖ File browser and downloads
- ‚úÖ Real-time chat rooms
- ‚úÖ Offline maps
- ‚úÖ All features work seamlessly

### 4. Test Network Access

1. **From your computer:** Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **From another device:** Go to `http://192.168.137.135:5173`
3. **Verify backend:** Both should access `http://192.168.137.135:5000/api/*`

## üîß Network Configuration Details

### What We've Configured:

1. **Frontend (Vite):**
   - Host: `0.0.0.0` (accepts connections from any IP)
   - Port: `5173`
   - Auto-detects network access

2. **Backend (Express):**
   - CORS: Allows your network IP
   - Socket.IO: Configured for network access
   - All API endpoints accessible

3. **Dynamic API URLs:**
   - Automatically detects if accessed via network
   - Uses correct backend URL for API calls
   - Works for localhost and network access

### Network Information Component:
- Click "üì° Network Info" button (bottom-right)
- Shows current access URL
- Provides shareable network URL
- Copy URL to clipboard functionality

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Can't connect to backend"
**Solution:**
1. Check if backend is running: `http://192.168.137.135:5000`
2. Verify firewall rules are active
3. Ensure both computers are on same network

### Issue: "CORS errors in browser console"
**Solution:**
- Backend is configured for your IP: `192.168.137.135`
- If your IP changes, update `server.js` and `chatSocket.js`

### Issue: "Chat not working from network"
**Solution:**
- Socket.IO is configured for network access
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Verify port 5000 is allowed in firewall

### Issue: "Maps not loading"
**Solution:**
- Maps work offline once downloaded
- Internet required for initial tile downloads
- IndexedDB storage works across network access

## üì± Mobile Access

Your app is fully responsive and works on:
- ‚úÖ Mobile phones
- ‚úÖ Tablets  
- ‚úÖ Laptops
- ‚úÖ Desktop computers

Just share the URL: `http://192.168.137.135:5173`
